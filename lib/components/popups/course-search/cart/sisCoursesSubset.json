We will cover several supervised methods for regression and classification, as well as unsupervised methods for clustering and dimensional reduction. To name a few in chronological order, the topics will include generalized linear regression, principal component analysis, nearest neighbor and Bayesian classifiers, support vector machines, logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, K-means clustering, Gaussian mixtures and Laplacian eigenmaps. The course uses Python and Jupyter Notebook and includes visualization techniques throughout the semester. Time permitting, an introduction to the Structured Query Language (SQL) is provided toward the end of the semester."

Its definition covers a wide spectrum of analytic and information technology topics, such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, statistical modeling, and efficient database development. This course will review these broad topics, and cover specific analytic and modeling techniques such as advanced data visualization, decision trees, neural networks, nearest neighbor, clustering, logistic regression, and association rules. Although some of the mathematics underlying these techniques will be discussed, our focus will be on the application of the techniques to real data and the interpretation of results. Because use of the computer is extremely important when “mining” large amounts of data, we will make substantial use of data mining software tools to learn the techniques and analyze datasets. Recommended Course Background: ( AS.110.202 OR AS.110.211 ) AND ( AS.110.201 OR AS.110.212 OR EN.553.291 )."

This course provides a thorough survey of relevant methods balancing the theory and the application aspects. Accordingly, the material and the discussions alternate between the methodology along with its underlying assumptions and the implementations along with their applications. We will cover several supervised methods for regression and classification, as well as unsupervised methods for clustering and dimensional reduction. To name a few in chronological order, the topics will include generalized linear regression, principal component analysis, nearest neighbor and Bayesian classifiers, support vector machines, logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, K-means clustering, Gaussian mixtures and Laplacian eigenmaps. The course uses Python and Jupyter Notebook and includes visualization techniques throughout the semester. Time permitting, an introduction to the Structured Query Language (SQL) is provided toward the end of the semester."

Its definition covers a wide spectrum of analytic and information technology topics, such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, statistical modeling, and efficient database development. This course will review these broad topics, and cover specific analytic and modeling techniques such as advanced data visualization, decision trees, neural networks, nearest neighbor, clustering, logistic regression, and association rules. Although some of the mathematics underlying these techniques will be discussed, our focus will be on the application of the techniques to real data and the interpretation of results. Because use of the computer is extremely important when “mining” large amounts of data, we will make substantial use of data mining software tools to learn the techniques and analyze datasets.\nRecommended Course Background: EN.553.413"

They’ll also study the basic poetic forms and meters, from the ballad to the sonnet, iambic pentameter to free verse.  Students will compose short stories and poems and workshop them in class.  This course is a prerequisite for most upper level courses. This course is part one of the year-long Introduction to Fiction and Poetry, and must be taken before AS.220.106."

Starting with tabular data containing gene abundance measurements from real RNA-seq experiments, students will perform exploratory and comparative analyses. The final capstone project involves developing original, reproducible analyses in an elegant report. No previous programming experience is required.\n\nStudents in this course will receive an email invitation to participate in a study of student quantitative skills and perceptions of scientific research.  Participation is voluntary."

They learn how to speak with confidence in a variety of formats and venues - Including extemporaneous speaking, job interviewing, leading a discussion, presenting a technical speech, and other relevant scenarios. Students learn how to develop effective slides that capture the main point with ease and clarity, hone their message, improve their delivery skills, and write thought-provoking, well-organized speeches that hold an audience's attention. No audits. Not open to students that have taken EN.661.150."

You will learn the art and skill of identifying medical device opportunities through observations, interviews, and research. Through a combination of lectures, hands on activities, and interactions with clinical stakeholders, you will gain the ability to identify unmet, unarticulated, and underserved  needs. Subsequently, you will learn the process of developing well thought out conceptual designs  that meet those needs. You will learn to apply an iterative approach towards innovation, by involving and engaging multiple stakeholders and their perspectives throughout the process. Throughout the course modules, you will also follow the journey of several innovative startups/products/ services, that started at JHU-CBID and went through the process outlined in this course.\n"

The class emphasizes writing clearly and persuasively, leveraging evidence effectively, working with key stakeholders, creating appropriate visuals and infographics, developing oral presentation skills, working in collaborative groups, giving and receiving feedback, and simulating the real-world environment in which most communication occurs. Projects include resumes, cover letters, memos, proposals, technical reports, and slides. All sections are open to students in any discipline or major.

As we go along, we will analyse some historical and contemporary empirical applications of these debates in different countries ranging from Korea and India to Algeria and Japan.

        "bio": "The late 18th century witnessed several political upheavals that reshaped global politics. The American, French, and Haitian revolutions profoundly transformed the concepts and conduct of politics at a transnational scale. They reshaped empires, introduced new ideas of freedom, invented practices of popular sovereignty, and formed novel rituals of political belonging. Their revolutionary violence was also coupled with reaction, circumscribed claims to universal liberty, and the retrenchment of slavery, racial hierarchy, and global inequality. This course explores this dynamic of revolution and reaction in this epoch-making thirty-year period in global history through the concepts of empire, freedom, and violence. How did empire, slavery and capitalism shape the contours of global politics in the age of revolutions? How were ideas of freedom circumscribed by the imperial practices of politics? How were universal conceptions of freedom shaped in and against colonial projects of rule? How fundamental was violence to the project of revolution? What purpose did it serve in the project of liberation? We conclude our course by examining the politics of memory to inquire into how these revolutions shape our present and whether revolution might still be desirable or even possible today."

Students rotate through multiple clinical disciplines and become part of the team of senior clinicians, surgeons, residents, fellows, nurses and medical technologists. \r\n\r\nThey learn to identify unmet medical device needs through direct observations in a variety of clinical settings including the hospital ward and operating room, interviews (with patients, doctors, nurses, hospital administration), literature survey, and more. Concurrently, they learn the process of filtering all observations to a few valid medical device opportunities by assessing the market size, intellectual property landscape, regulatory framework, and competitor dynamics in addition to the clinical impact that such a device could have. \r\n\r\nThe ability to identify a relevant medical device need is an important first step in the medical device innovation cycle; this course aims to provide students with practical hands- on training in that process.\r\n\r\nThis summer course is required for CBID masters students only and is not open to any other students."
